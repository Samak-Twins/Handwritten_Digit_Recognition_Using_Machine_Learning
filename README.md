# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Machine Learning
The project focuses on recognizing handwritten digits using machine learning. The project uses supervised machine learning and the training data consists of around 50 test images and around 150 training images of 4 digits (0 to 3). All these images are 28 x 28 pixels.  The user has to feed a 28 x 28 pixels image with white background and black handwritten digit, which is then processed, and using machine learning the most appropriate result is displayed.
